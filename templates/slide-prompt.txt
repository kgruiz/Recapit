Transcribe the slide deck into Markdown while preserving per-slide structure.

Guidelines:
- Use a level-2 heading for each slide title (or `## Slide N` when untitled).
- Mirror bullet and numbered list nesting; keep speaker notes or captions beneath the relevant slide.
- Render equations with `$...$` (inline) or `$$...$$` (block) and fence code snippets with triple backticks.
- Replace non-text visuals with `[Placeholder: description]` only when necessary to reference them.
