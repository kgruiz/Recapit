Convert the following LaTeX content into Markdown while preserving formatting, equations, and structures as closely as possible. This is not an exhaustive list of LaTeX-to-Markdown conversions—ensure all possible elements are translated appropriately.

- Math:
  - Use `$...$` for inline math and `$$...$$` for display math.
- Headings:
  - Convert `\section{}` into `#`, `\subsection{}` into `##`, and so on.
- Lists:
  - Convert `\begin{itemize}` to `-` and `\begin{enumerate}` to `1.`.
- Text Formatting:
  - Convert `\textbf{}` to `**bold**` and `\textit{}` to `*italic*`.
- Tables:
  - Convert `\begin{tabular}` into a Markdown table.
- Code Blocks:
  - Convert `\begin{verbatim}` into triple backticks (```).
- Figures & TikZ:
  - Replace `\includegraphics{}` and `\begin{tikzpicture}` with `[Placeholder: Image or Diagram]`.
  - If `\caption{}` is present, include it inside the placeholder as text.
  - If no caption or description is available, make a best guess based on the file path or filename.
    - If a guess is provided, begin with `POSSIBLY:` or `GUESS:`.
- References & Citations:
  - Convert `\cite{}` to `[citation needed]`.
  - Convert `\ref{}` to `[see section X]`.
- Ignore:
  - Remove unnecessary LaTeX-specific commands that have no Markdown equivalent (e.g., `\usepackage{}`, `\newcommand{}`, etc.).

Ensure that all other valid LaTeX constructs are converted appropriately, even if they are not explicitly listed above.

Return only the converted Markdown without explanations or additional text.
