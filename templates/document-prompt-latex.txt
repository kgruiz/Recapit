Transcribe the document verbatim into LaTeX using the provided preamble.

Guidelines:
- Mirror headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and math environments exactly as they appear.
- Respect existing alignment in equations (`align`, `gather`, etc.) and keep semantic macros when visible.
- Use `[Placeholder: ...]` only when referencing non-text visuals, and mark unreadable text as `[illegible]`.
- Avoid adding commentary or restructuring beyond the source material.
