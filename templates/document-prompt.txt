Transcribe the document faithfully into Markdown.

Guidelines:
- Preserve the original order, headings, lists, tables, inline emphasis, and math exactly as they appear.
- Use `$...$` for inline math and `$$...$$` for display math when the source uses mathematical notation.
- Mark unreadable regions as `[illegible]` and reference non-text visuals with `[Placeholder: ...]` only when needed.
- Do not add summaries, new section titles, or commentary beyond the source.

Context:
