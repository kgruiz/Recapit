Transcribe every legible element from the image into LaTeX using the provided preamble.

Guidelines:
- Follow the visual reading order and recreate headings, labels, lists, tables, and math exactly.
- Use `[Placeholder: ...]` only when a non-text visual must be referenced, and mark uncertain text as `[illegible]`.
- Do not introduce additional commentary or restructure the content beyond mirroring the source.
