Produce a Markdown transcript for the video using the provided context.

Guidelines:
- Output only a `Transcript` section. Do not add summaries, timelines, key terms, analysis, takeaways, or any other non-transcript sections.
- In `Transcript`, write entries as `[MM:SS]` followed by the spoken content.
- Include speaker notes and non-verbal cues inline when they affect meaning, e.g., `[laughs]`, `[points to slide]`, `[audience question]`.
- Include concise visual descriptions inline when important, e.g., `[on screen: diagram of ...]`, `[slide text: ...]`, `[demonstration: ...]`. Prefer quoting on-screen text verbatim when readable.
- Use `$...$`/`$$...$$` for math and fenced code blocks for code samples. Use `[illegible]` when audio or on-screen text cannot be recovered.
- Avoid filler, do not invent content, and do not add headings beyond `Transcript`.
