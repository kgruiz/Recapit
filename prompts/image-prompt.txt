Transcribe every piece of legible text from the image into Markdown.

Guidelines:
- Preserve the reading order and replicate headings, labels, lists, tables, and math as they appear.
- Use `$...$` or `$$...$$` when the source displays mathematics.
- Mark unreadable content as `[illegible]` and describe non-text visuals only when a placeholder is necessary.
- Do not introduce commentary or restructure the content beyond mirroring the source layout.

Context:
{{PREAMBLE}}
