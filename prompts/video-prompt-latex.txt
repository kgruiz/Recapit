Produce a LaTeX transcript of the video using the provided preamble.

Guidelines:
- Output only `\section*{Transcript}`. Do not add summaries, timelines, key terms, analysis, takeaways, or any other non-transcript sections.
- In Transcript, write entries as `[MM:SS]` followed by the spoken content.
- Include speaker notes and non-verbal cues inline when they affect meaning (e.g., `[laughs]`, `[points to slide]`, `[audience question]`).
- Include concise visual descriptions inline when important (e.g., `[on screen: diagram of ...]`, `[slide text: ...]`, `[demonstration: ...]`). Prefer quoting on-screen text verbatim when readable.
- Use LaTeX math environments for equations. Use `[illegible]` when audio or on-screen text cannot be recovered.
- Avoid filler, do not invent content, and do not add headings beyond Transcript.
