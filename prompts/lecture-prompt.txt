Transcribe the lecture notes into Markdown exactly as written.

Guidelines:
- Keep the original ordering, headings, bullet structure, and math notation intact.
- Preserve speaker annotations or margin notes in place; mark unclear handwriting with `[illegible]` or `[sic]` when needed.
- Use `$...$` for inline math and `$$...$$` for display math if the source contains equations.
- Only add timestamps or labels when they explicitly exist in the source material.
