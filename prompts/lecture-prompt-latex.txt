Transcribe the lecture notes into LaTeX exactly as they appear.

Guidelines:
- Preserve ordering, headings, handwritten annotations, and emphasis; include timestamps only if present.
- Render math with appropriate environments (`$...$`, `align`, `gather`, etc.) and keep existing notation.
- Mark uncertain or unreadable text with `[sic]` or `[illegible]`, and reference non-text visuals using `[Placeholder: ...]` only when necessary.
- Avoid paraphrasing or introducing new commentary beyond the source.
